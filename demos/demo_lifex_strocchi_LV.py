# # Life X - 01_strocchi_LV
#
# Life X has published their own implementation of the LDRB algorithm and with that they also published a lot of example meshes. This demo aims to try out this implementation of the LDRB algorithm on these example meshes. The LifeX example meshes can be found at https://zenodo.org/record/5810269#.YeEjWi8w1B0, which also contains a DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5810269.
#
# This demo assumes that you have downloaded the folder with the meshes in the same format as they are uploaded on zenodo, so that the gmsh files are located in a folder called `lifex_fiber_generation_examples/mesh`.
#
# First we import the necessary packages. Note that we also import [`cardiac-geometries`](https://computationalphysiology.github.io/cardiac_geometries/) which is used for converting from `.msh` (gmsh) to `.xdmf` (FEnICS).

# First we will load the mesh and markers. This is a large mesh that you probably want to run in parallel, but you need to first convert the mesh to a fenics mesh and that has to be done in serial. You can make sure that the mesh is saved by setting `unlink = False`.
# To run the in parallel you can e.g do
# ```
# mpirun -n 4 python3 demo_lifex_strocchi_LV.py
# ```
# which will run the demo on 4 processors.

# We will specify an output directory for the mesh
outdir = Path("01_strocchi_LV")

# If we run in serial we will convert the gmsh file to dolfin, otherwise we load the mesh and facet function directly from the folder.
