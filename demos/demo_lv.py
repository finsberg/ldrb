# # Creating fibers on a simple LV ellipsoid
#
# In this demo we will create fibers from the simple idealized LV ellipsoid. We will use a library called [`cardiac-geometries`](https://computationalphysiology.github.io/cardiac_geometries/) to generate the mesh.
# This library can be installed with `pip`, i.e `pip install cardiac-geometries`, but note that it also requires `gmsh` to be installed.
#

import dolfin as df

import ldrb
import cardiac_geometries

#
# Here we just create a lv mesh using `cardiac-geometries``
#

geometry = cardiac_geometries.create_lv_ellipsoid()

#
# The mesh is stored as an attribute mesh
#

mesh = geometry.mesh

#
# The facet function (function with marking for the boundaries) is stored as an attribute `ffun`
#

ffun = geometry.ffun

#
# A dictionary with keys and values for the markers as stored in the attribute `markers`. These markers are loaded from the underlying gmsh files, and has to be slightly modified to work with `ldrb` as `ldrb` expected a dictionary with the keys being `"base"`, `"epi"` and `"lv"` (and alternatively `"rv"`).
#

markers = geometry.markers
markers = {
    "base": geometry.markers["BASE"][0],
    "epi": geometry.markers["EPI"][0],
    "lv": geometry.markers["ENDO"][0],
}

#
# Also if you want to to this demo in parallel you should create the mesh
# in serial and save it to e.g xdmf
#

with df.XDMFFile(mesh.mpi_comm(), "mesh.xdmf") as xdmf:
    xdmf.write(mesh)

#
# And when you run the code in parallel you should load the mesh from the file.
#

mesh = df.Mesh()
with df.XDMFFile("mesh.xdmf") as xdmf:
    xdmf.read(mesh)

#
# You should also save the facet function
#

with df.XDMFFile(mesh.mpi_comm(), "ffun.xdmf") as xdmf:
    xdmf.write(ffun)

#
# and read it agin
#

ffun = df.MeshFunction("size_t", mesh, 2)
with df.XDMFFile("ffun.xdmf") as xdmf:
    xdmf.read(ffun)
#
# Decide on the angles you want to use
#

angles = dict(
    alpha_endo_lv=60,  # Fiber angle on the endocardium
    alpha_epi_lv=-60,  # Fiber angle on the epicardium
    beta_endo_lv=0,  # Sheet angle on the endocardium
    beta_epi_lv=0,  # Sheet angle on the epicardium
)

#
# Choose space for the fiber fields
# This is a string on the form {family}_{degree}
#

fiber_space = "Lagrange_1"

# Compute the microstructure

fiber, sheet, sheet_normal = ldrb.dolfin_ldrb(
    mesh=mesh,
    fiber_space=fiber_space,
    ffun=ffun,
    markers=markers,
    **angles,
)

# Store the results

with df.HDF5File(mesh.mpi_comm(), "lv.h5", "w") as h5file:
    h5file.write(fiber, "/fiber")
    h5file.write(sheet, "/sheet")
    h5file.write(sheet_normal, "/sheet_normal")

# If you run in parallel you should skip the visualization step and do that in
# serial in stead. In that case you can read the the functions from the xml
# Using the following code


V = ldrb.space_from_string(fiber_space, mesh, dim=3)

fiber = df.Function(V)
sheet = df.Function(V)
sheet_normal = df.Function(V)

with df.HDF5File(mesh.mpi_comm(), "lv.h5", "r") as h5file:
    h5file.read(fiber, "/fiber")
    h5file.read(sheet, "/sheet")
    h5file.read(sheet_normal, "/sheet_normal")


# You can also store files in XDMF which will also compute the fiber angle as scalars on the glyph to be visualised in Paraview. Note that these functions don't work (yet) using mpirun

# (These function are not tested in parallel)
ldrb.fiber_to_xdmf(fiber, "lv_fiber")
ldrb.fiber_to_xdmf(sheet, "lv_sheet")
